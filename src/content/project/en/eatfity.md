Mobile platform designed to help users achieve a healthier lifestyle through
nutrition and fitness.

The user has at his disposal a whole catalogue of exercises and routines to improve
their physical conditioning. In addition, the user is also offered a varied
collection of recipes and diets, depending on the objective. If desired, the user can
hire specialists in the sector and contact them through the application.

<b>Responsibilities</b>

I worked as a full-stack developer, collaborating on both the frontend and the
backend. I was tasked with the responsibility of ensuring the correct development and
deployment for both Android and iOS platforms of the mobile application. I also
worked on the development and integration of the API. Furthermore, I was responsible
for the hosting of the backend on a VPS and the integration with several external
services, such as OpenAI or Firebase.
