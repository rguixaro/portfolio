<b>Responsibilities</b>

I worked as a full-stack developer, collaborating on both the frontend and the
backend. I was tasked with the responsibility of ensuring the correct development and
deployment for both Android and iOS platforms of the mobile application. I also
worked on the development and integration of the API. Furthermore, I was responsible
for the hosting of the backend on a VPS.
