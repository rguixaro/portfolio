Mobile application destined for MusicAdders clients to help them manage their account
and view analyses of their products with their social statistics. It also offers the
possibility to upload new products, be they a single or an album.

<b>Responsibilities</b>

I was part of the mobile frontend team responsible for the development of the
application. I was assigned the responsibility of ensuring the correct development
and deployment for both Android and iOS platforms. Furthermore, I worked on the
integration process with an extensive external API that provided the necessary data
for the application.
