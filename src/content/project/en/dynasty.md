Web application designed to register a family tree. It allows to consult and modify
the data of any member of the ‘dynasty’, as well as add new members. Hosted, with the
API and the (non-relational) database, on AWS.

<b>Responsibilities</b>

It is a personal project, so I developed the entire software, from the architecture
design, to the deployment using several AWS Services.
